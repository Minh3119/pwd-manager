    Project is still in development so here's how to setup things for the script to work

1. Clone the repo

2. Init python-venv for this repo
- If not installed venv, run `sudo apt install python-venv`
- run `python -m venv myenv` (myenv or whatever you like)

3. activate venv : `source myenv/bin/activate` (for linux)
                `myenv\Scripts\activate` (for Windows)

4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. `pip install --editable .`

6. Installation should be done. Try `vaulty --help`.
Note: all commands and developments should be done in venv.

7. Exit venv: type `deactivate`
